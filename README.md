# cognitive_AI_coursework

'Cog_AI_coursework_percepDec' is the code I used to answer Q2b. The task I trained the models to complete was 'PerceptualDecisionMaking-v0'
'Cog_AI_coursework_ConDec' is the code I used to answer Q2c. The task I trained the models to complete was 'ContextDecisionMaking-v0'
'Cog_AI_coursework_Spatial_embedding' is the code I used to answer Q2d. This code trains a Leaky RNN with and without spatial embedding.
